## What's Multi-view clsutering?
Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to group samples (objects/instances/points) with similar structures or patterns into the same group (cluster) and samples with dissimilar ones into different groups by combining the available feature information of different views and searching for consistent clusters across different views.(最好有图片呈现
